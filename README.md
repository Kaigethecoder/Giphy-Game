# Giphy Game
 > Giphy Game is a project that was created in a group setting for my final project with Grand Circus.  We accomplished this in Visual Studio using ASP.NET Core with Angular project.
 
 ## Project Description
 - The Giphy Game was created with a specially curated prompt deck to entice players of all ages to combat boredom in just a few clicks.
 
 ## What can the user do?
 - Repeatedly mix prompts with Gifs of different categories for a laugh
 - Create a player
 - Read all players
 - Update player fields
 - Delete a player
 - Donate to our venmo(Get Rick-Rolled)
 - See about the project(See our pitch video on YouTube)
 
 ## How did we do it?
 - Created back-end API by linking SQL database containing Players and PromptCards with Entity Framework.
 - Used a key to retrieve Gifs from Giphy API.
 - Created several methods in GameController to demonstrate all aspects of CRUD.
 - Created several classes in C# as well as TypeScript.
 - Angular component-based architecture.
 
 ## Languages Used
 - C#
 - HTML5
 - CSS
 - JavaScript
 - TypeScript
 - SQL
 - More?
 
 ## Stretch Goals
 > The Giphy Game was originally supposed to be a multiplayer game similar to Cards Against Humanity.  If we had more time we would have tried to:
 - Create Multi-Player environment that allows players to pick the Gifs to match with a prompt.
 - Judge selects winner of a round.
 - Repeat process until a certain amount of points is reached by a player and display the results.
 - Store Rounds and Games in database to replay games.
 - Store Prompts matched with specific Gifs that players found hilarious to share with future players or revisit later.
